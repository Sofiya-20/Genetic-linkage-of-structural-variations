# Genetic-linkage-of-structural-variations
# 1. selection for the genes with no Cis-eQTLs
Folder:analysis/Control_SNPs_selection
SNP seletion is random everytime, final output of SNPs used for this analysis is in the following file
Files to upload: control_positions, map_dt, control_snps_quantilles.csv

#2. Find SVs that overlap in the 2kb upstream regions of all the genes
Files: control and test selected raw and freq files, and all the subset files for test and control set and the script

#3 Merging the SVs with genes and SNPs and pre-filtering
#4. Allele_SV_linkage
